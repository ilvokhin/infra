* How to store secrets in the repo?
* Is there a way to make playbooks cross-platform? For example have same setup
  for CentOS and Arch Linux? Is it possible to extend it to macOS?
* Figure out directory structure.
* How to bootstrap python?

SETUP

CentOS 8 Stream EOL is May 31, 2024, so need to re-setup sun.ilvokhin.com
first.

* Git Server (SSH + HTTP/HTTPS).
* CGit (git.ilvokhin.com).
* Blog (blog.ilvokhin.com).
* Homepage (ilvokhin.com).
* Ip (ip.ilvokhin.com).

CentOS 7 EOL is 30 June, 2024, it is everything else.

Mail server at mail.ilvokhin.com:

* Postfix.
* Dovecot.

VPNs at gate.ilvokhin.com:

* OpenVPN to Amsterdam.
* TOR.
* OpenVPN to TOR.
* OpenVPN to water.
* OpenVPN to flame.
* Telegram Proxy. Do I still need it?
* Setup VPN to AMS with a native macOS interface? L2TP over IPSec, Cisco IPSec, IKEv2?
* Setup VPN to Moscow home network?

Stretch goal is to re-setup water and flame as well, but this is not urgent and
a bit tricky to do remotely.


DOTFILES

Main idea is to manage dotfiles everywhere with ansible.
